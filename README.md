# Yet Another TS-Express APIs

## Description

This repository was made initialy following a [Express Typescript tutorial](https://wanago.io/courses/typescript-express-tutorial/), but at some point I started disagreeing with the way that was done, and started changing and fixing a LOT of stuff, updating all the libraries, improving the build flow, and ended up making my own thing.

The [_mongo_](https://github.com/spersico/yatse-apis/tree/mongo) branch contains the version with **MongoDB**.

[TODO](https://github.com/spersico/yatse-apis/issues): The [_postgres_](https://github.com/spersico/yatse-apis/tree/postgres) branch contains the version with **PostgreSQL**.

## Installation

I'm assuming that, for the mongo version you've got a mongoDB instance running on port 27017, and for postgress (TODO)... 

```bash
 npm i
```

## Build & run

```bash
 npm run build & npm start
```

## Run in dev mode

```bash
 npm run dev
```
